# instagram-post-on-python-and-linux-lite

This is simply a proof that with selenium, a mobile phone useragent, and pyautogui you can automate posting on instagram. Will eventually automate uploading an entire folder of files but I wanted to just put this out for a medium article. You can modify this to fit your machines file directory system, read the pyautogui documentation for things more cmplicated than just arrow key presses and enter key presses.
